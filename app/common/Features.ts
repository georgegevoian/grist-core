   * new document.  If, after an operation, the limit would be exceeded, that operation
   * is denied.  That means it is possible to exceed limits if the limits were not in
   * place when shares/docs were originally being added.  The action that would need
   * to be taken when infringement is pre-existing is not so obvious.
